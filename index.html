		India hosted the Asian Games in New Delhi in 1951 and 1982. The current
		Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports was initially set up as the
		Department of Sports in 1982 at the time of organisation of the Games in
		New Delhi. Its name was changed to the Department of Youth Affairs &
		Sports during celebration of the International Youth Year in 1985. India
		has also hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events,
		including the 1987, 1996 and 2011 Cricket World Cups, the 2003 Afro-Asian
		Games, the 2010 Hockey World Cup, and the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Major
		international sporting events annually held in India include the Chennai
		Open, the Mumbai Marathon and the Delhi Half Marathon. The country hosted
